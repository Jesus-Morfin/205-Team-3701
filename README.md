First the user should think of a song title and artisit in mind

Also they must require a Microphone to run the program for option 1

Next the user gets to choose between an option to use the speech recoginiton as option 1 or the search bar as option 2

If you are trying to find a video that you want to appear, you have to be specific otherwise it may give what you are looking for but not that video

Future Work: To make it mobile phone friendly to use in the future, make the search bar more forgiving when searching video, add more features like searching up a person or going into websites,
and keep user previous search history.
